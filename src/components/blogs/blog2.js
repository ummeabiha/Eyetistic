      title="What's Glaucoma?"
      author="Maham Khan"

      introduction="Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is often referred to as the silent thief of sight because it can cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. Early detection and proper management are crucial in preventing further deterioration and preserving your eyesight. In this blog post, we will explore the causes, risks, and preventive measures associated with glaucoma."
      bodytitle="Causes of Glaucoma:"
      causes="Glaucoma typically occurs when there is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP). This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve, resulting in vision impairment. While high IOP is a major risk factor, other factors that contribute to glaucoma include:

            Age: The risk of developing glaucoma increases with age, particularly after the age of 60.
            
            Family History: Individuals with a family history of glaucoma are at a higher risk of developing the disease.
            
            Ethnicity: Certain ethnic groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, have a higher predisposition to glaucoma.
            
            Medical Conditions: Conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular diseases can increase the risk of glaucoma.
            
            Eye Trauma or Surgery: Previous eye injuries or surgeries can disrupt the normal flow of fluids within the eye, leading to increased pressure."

      conclusion="Glaucoma is a serious eye condition that demands attention and proactive measures. Regular eye examinations, especially for individuals at higher risk, play a vital role in detecting glaucoma in its early stages. Timely intervention through prescribed treatments, including eye drops, medications, laser therapy, or surgery, can help manage the disease effectively. Remember, glaucoma is a chronic condition that requires continuous monitoring, even if the symptoms are not immediately apparent."
