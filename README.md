# Eyetistic - Full-Stack Web Application

## Project Overview
Eyetistic provides optic services through its convenient E-commerce store and insightful blogs. The platform allows users to purchase high-quality lenses and spectacles from the comfort of their homes. In addition to the E-commerce store, Eyetistic features informative blogs to educate users about the latest eye diseases and technological advancements in ophthalmology.

## Project Description
Eyetistic aims to create an interactive web platform for buying reliable optic wear and accessing informative eye blogs. The project involves thorough research on trending technologies, competitive product sourcing, blog content creation, a user-friendly UI, and a reliable delivery system. The scope also includes establishing a robust backend system for the web application, along with continuous maintenance and improvement for maximum user satisfaction.

### Flow of the Project
1. Evaluate features and identify associated risks.
2. Prioritize features based on user interest.
3. Plan and select suitable libraries for development.
4. Divide the workload and work on respective modules.
5. Integrate different modules and resolve errors.
6. Upload on Github for backup.

## Tech Stack

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
